current issues:
need a way to reserve globals & vars
unable to modify a var after it has been created (correct behaviour, needs more boilerplate to allow certain ops)
separation of globals & vars needs to be integrated in to the lookup, else vars only with compiler position manipulation
  likely slower, causes issues with how scopes are defined. when a function (with no known implementation) is prepared to be called, every item in the current scope would need to be incremented as to make room for the (likely) undefined global call.

    solutions:
      full separation of globals and variables
        no difference to implementation

      vm interprets fn scopes differently, allowing functions to be zero indexed
        likely slower
