current outstanding:
usage of string_util is sparse and debatably confusing
decide how to handle the interner (be better to be an internal lox string impl detail)
clear lookup and assert it only has one scope (global) on vm start
improve return behaviour (detect dead code, don't construct code afterwards, no implicit null retcode)
implement unit testing
improve os x / win timer
clean up/update win solution
