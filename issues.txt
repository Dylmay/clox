# The TODO List:
## Current outstanding:
* usage of string_util is sparse and debatably confusing
* decide how to handle the interner (be better to be an internal lox string impl detail)
* clear lookup and assert it only has one scope (global) on vm start
* improve return behaviour (detect dead code, don't construct code afterwards, no implicit null retcode)
* improve os x / win timer
* clean up/update win solution
* typing is now required
  * Compiler can guess the type but it is needed so definitions are known
  * for classes
* classes should be scoped to global?
  * class definitions are needed to allow property usage
* implement structs?
